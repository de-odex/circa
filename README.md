circa
=====

A Nim port of [slider](https://github.com/llllllllll/slider), "Utilities for working with osu! files and data."

circa comes from `circle` and `catch`; circle representing osu's standard game mode, osu!, and catch representing osu's catch the beat game mode, osu!catch, though circa supports all game modes

Dependencies
------------

circa requires Nim 1.0, though older versions have not been tested. Nim 0.20 may work, as I do not recall using any 1.0 specific features.

circa also requires glm, for mathematics, and other modules for programming tools. See circa.nimble for the full list of dependencies.
